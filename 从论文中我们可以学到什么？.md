# 从论文中我们可以学到什么？

为什么要掌握这些方法？

内容上：了解该文章在领域的“位置”

文法上：理解published paper的行文逻辑



**1. Create a citation for the paper**

**2. Analyze the introduction**

  a. How long is it (pages or words)?

  b. How many paragraphs of contextual information (motivation/background) are included?

  c. Are there any visuals in this section? What types?

  d. Highlight the research question or problem the authors trying to solve? Underline the question or problem/gap statement.

  e. What is the authors’ purpose or goal? Highlight it.

  f. Do the authors state their primary contributions to solving the problem? If so, how are the contributions presented (e.g., paragraph, list)?

**3. Analyze the section that describes the approach / methods**

  a. Does this section have sub-sections? If so, how many? Are they numbered and/or titled?

  b. How detailed are the explanations within these sub-sections?

  c. Note places in the methods where the authors offer a rationale for a particular approach or decision.

  d. Are there any visuals in this section? How many? Types?

  e. Is there information about statistical Analysis in this section? Where does it appear?

**4. Analyze the results and discussion**

  a. Are results and discussion combined or in separate sections?

  b. Are there sub-sections?

  c. How does the results (or results/discussion) section begin? (i.e. study the content of the first paragraph—if there is a separate discussion section, look at the first paragraph of that section, rather than that of results).

  d. List the key findings of the study. Were they easy to identify? Why or why not?

  e. Why do you think the authors chose to place the results in the order in which they appear?

  f. What kinds of visuals are included to support the key findings? Are the figure titles informative? Study the captions. Are they brief (i.e., one line of text) or more descriptive/argumentative?

  g. If the results and discussion are combined, mark places in the text where the authors compare their results to those found in other studies.

**5. Examine the conclusion (If there’s no standalone conclusion, examine the last paragraph of the discussion.)**

  a. How would you describe the content of this section/paragraph?

  b. Are broader implications/applications discussed in this section/paragraph?

  c. Does this section identify opportunities for future work or is there a separate section for it?

6. **Are the limitations of the work discussed in a section or are they integrated into other sections of the paper?**

7. **Is there a supplementary information section (or other appendices)? If so, what kinds of material are included?**

8. **How many references does the article include? Which section includes the most citations?**
